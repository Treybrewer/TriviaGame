*build html and css
	-PGA theme?

*maybe animations? or an animation function w/ resets
	-don't forget to record starting position for any element that is 		animated and to create a function to reset after animation.  Create 		an object containing all the elements to animate (maybe with their 		animation functions as well). 
	Perphaps funciton reset() { (for loop targeting the array) 
	-if statement targeting animationArray[i] = hidden.animate(target 		property: value)
	-that should work
	-build an animation function and attach to the begining click, make 	
	sure it pulls from the question and answer array.  Include a for loop 
	to animate it

*show a question
	-this should be included in the question/answer object
	-could also build a show question function and include it in the 
	document.ready

*attach a set time out to it
	-this can be done with a set interval

*create a guessRemaining variable, set it to twenty
	-attach to start function

*build a function to show the timer
	-this should reset every time a question is answered and a new 	
	question appears
	-also should show lose screen when timer hits 0

*create an if statement for when the time runs out
	-run lose screen function();

*build a win screen function
	-should show winner and maybe a questions anwered right/wrong 		  counter
	-should hide the question, and answers
	-should pause timer
	-should show questions remaining
*build a lose screen function
	-should show you lose  and maybe a questions anwered 	  	  right/wrong counter
	-should hide question and answers
	-should pause timer 
	-should show guess remaining ( guessingRemaining = [20])
	  lose function(guessRemaining -= 1;)

*create an object containing answers and questions

*create a funciton for right/wrong answer selection
	-maybe create a sepereate object for the right answer and 
	  compare it the question object
	-include an if statement for wrong selection, lose screen function	  ();/winscreenfunction();
